<h2>Sulaymaniyah</h2>
<h4>History of Sulaymaniyah</h4>
<h5>While economic and cultural activity in the Sulaymaniyah region can be traced back hundreds of years, the modern city of Sulaymaniyah was founded by a Kurdish prince in 1784.[1] The city has since grown to accommodate a population of over 1.5 million, and has a burgeoning economy that relies mainly on agriculture and tourism.[2] It is an important economic center for northern Iraq and has been named the cultural center for Sorani-speaking Kurds continuously since 1992.</h5>

<h5>Slemani is also an important center of Kurdish culture, and is recognized for producing numerous Kurdish poets and writers.[3] The University of Sulaymaniyah was opened in 1968 with instruction in English, Arabic and Kurdish. It has schools for medicine, agriculture, engineering and the arts. It is the largest university in Iraqi Kurdistan.

    Sulaymaniyah is also known for its Newroz celebrations. Many Iranians come to Sulaymaniyah to celebrate the holiday, because of strict laws at home in Iran.
